        <p><b>Hi My Name is Zara I'm 10 year old and I've been In Kidocode For About 3 or 2 Year Now.
        In Kidocode I teach student! I start teaching at the age of 9, I learn how to create Website,
        I learn Coding and a lot more</b></p>
        <p>I love coding! And why is that you ask? Because  coding is a fundamental skill that children need
        to learn regardless of their future career to lead the world of the future. coding allows kids to be creative,
        and utilise the full power of the technology at their fingertips. It's really fun doing coding, and instead of 
        playing game you should create your own game</p>
